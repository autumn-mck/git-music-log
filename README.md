# git-music-log

### What is this?

The music display I made a bit ago (https://mck.is/blog/2024/small-projects-for-fun/) is great, but it has an issue: it doesn't show what I've listened to previously.

So what's commonly used for tracking changes over time? `git`! So I made a terrible idea: a script that logs what I listen to with git commits.

The version on github is only used for the script as I don't want to be spamming my github account with commits every time I listen to a song. <https://git.mck.is/autumn/git-music-log> is the demo repo, but it won't be updated often because why would I actually use this?

### How do I use it?

1. Don't. It's a terrible idea.
